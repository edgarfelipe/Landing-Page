        <p>So perhaps, you've generated some fancy text, and you're content that you can now copy and paste your fancy
          text
          in the comments section of funny cat videos, but perhaps you're wondering how it's even possible to change the
          font of your text? Is it some sort of hack? Are you copying and pasting an actual font?</p>

      <p>Well, the answer is actually no - rather than generating fancy fonts, this converter creates fancy symbols. The
        explanation starts with unicode; an industry standard which creates the specification for thousands of different
        symbols and characters. All the characters that you see on your electronic devices, and printed in books, are
        likely specified by the unicode standard.
      </p>
      <p>Amongst the hundreds of thousands of symbols which are in the unicode text specifications are certain
        characters
        which resemble, or are variations of the alphabet and other keyword symbols. For example, if we can take the
        phrase "thug life" and convert its characters into the fancy letters "ùñôùñçùñöùñå ùñëùñéùñãùñä" which are a set of
        unicode symbols. These different sets of fancy text letters are scattered all throughout the unicode
        specification, and so to create a fancy text translator, it's just a matter of finding these sets of letters and
        symbols, and linking them to their normal alphabetical equivalents.</p>
      <p>If there's anything that I can do to improve this online fancy generator thing (e.g. by adding other font
        styles
        that you've found), then please let me know in the suggestions box! If you've found new copyable fonts that
        aren't
        in this generator, please share them below as well. Thanks!</p>
